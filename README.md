## ember-cli-compass-compiler

This addon adds [compass](http://compass-style.org/) compiler for [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/).

### Installation

In your Ember CLI app (>= v0.0.37) run the following:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-compass-compiler
```

### Requirements

`compass` should be installed on your machine in order for this addon to work.

To install `compass`, run:

```bash
gem install compass
```

> Note: Now that your ember-cli project relies on ruby code, it is highly recommended
  that you document your gem dependencies in a Gemfile manifest. Using bundler will also 
  ensure the proper gems are used during Broccoli's build process.
  
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'compass', '~>1.0'
```

### Usage

After installation everything should work automatically.

A file named `appname.scss` in your `app/styles` directory should be compiled into `appname.css` 
with `ember build` or `ember serve` commands.


To override default options of compass compiler, do the following in your Brocfile:

```javascript
var app = new EmberApp({
  compassOptions: {
    outputStyle: 'expanded',
    require: ['sass-css-importer', 'susy']
  }
});
```
